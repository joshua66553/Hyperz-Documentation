# ProgramKillers

Here I just have a bunch of .bat files that stop programs that you may need to stop, allowing you to no longer need to open Task Manager and shut down apps, do it with a simple click!

# Install:

Download .ZIP [here](https://github.com/Itz-Hyperz/ProgramKillers/)
Extract the ones you want
Run them when you need to kill the program / task
You're Done!
